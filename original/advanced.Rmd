```

We have covered a lot of material in the previous chapters,
but have only scratched the surface of what R can do ~~to~~ for us.
To wrap up,
we will look briefly at a few of its more advanced capabilities.

## How can we use Python with R?

You can put Python code in R Markdown documents:

```{python}
print("Hello R")
```

but how can those chunks interact with your R and vice versa?
The answer is a package called [reticulate][reticulate]
that provides two-way communication between Python and R.
To use it,
run `install.packages("reticulate")`.
By default,
it uses the system-default Python:

```{r}
Sys.which("python")
```

but you can configure it to use different versions,
or to use `virtualenv` or a Conda environment—see [the document][reticulate-configure] for details.

> If you want to run the Pythonic bits of code we present as well as the R,
> run `install.packages("reticulate")`
> and then set the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable
> to point at the version of Python you want to use
> *before* you launch RStudio.
> This is necessary because you may have a system-installed version somewhere like `/usr/bin/python`
> and a conda-managed version in `~/anaconda3/bin/python`.

```

### How can we access data across languages?

The most common way to use reticulate is to do some calculations in Python and then use the results in R
or vice versa.
To show how this works,
let's read our infant HIV data into a Pandas data frame:

```{python}
import pandas
data = pandas.read_csv('results/infant_hiv.csv')
print(data.head())
```

All of our Python variables are available in our R session as part of the `py` object,
so `py$data` is our data frame inside a chunk of R code:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
head(py$data)
```

reticulate handles type conversions automatically,
though there are a few tricky cases:
for example,
the number `9` is a float in R,
so if you want an integer in Python,
you have to add the trailing `L` (for "long") and write it `9L`.

On the other hand,
reticulate translates between 0-based and 1-based indexing.
Suppose we create a character vector in R:

```{r}
elements = c('hydrogen', 'helium', 'lithium', 'beryllium')
```

Hydrogen is in position 1 in R:

```{r}
elements[1]
```

but position 0 in Python:

```{python}
print(r.elements[0])
```

Note our use of the object `r` in our Python code:
just `py$whatever` gives us access to Python objects in R,
`r.whatever` gives us access to R objects in Python.

### How can we call functions across languages?

We don't have to run Python code,
store values in a variable,
and then access that variable from R:
we can call the Python directly (or vice versa).
For example,
we can use Python's random number generator in R as follows:

```{r}
pyrand <- import("random")
pyrand$gauss(0, 1)
```

(There's no reason to do this—R's random number generator is just as strong—but it illustrates the point.)

We can also source Python scripts.
For example,
suppose that `countries.py` contains this function:

```{python code=readLines('countries.py'), eval=FALSE}
```

We can run that script using `source_python`:

```{r}
source_python('countries.py')
```

There is no output because all the script did was define a function.
By default,
that function and all other top-level variables defined in the script are now available in R:

```{r}
get_countries('results/infant_hiv.csv')
```

There is one small pothole in this.
When the script is run,
the special Python variable `__name__` is set to `'__main__'`,
i.e.,
the script thinks it is being called from the command line.
If it includes a conditional block to handle command-line arguments like this:

```{python eval=FALSE}
if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_file, output_files = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2:]
    main(input_file, output_files)
```

then that block will be executed,
but will fail because `sys.argv` won't include anything.

## How does object-oriented programming work in R?

Programmers spend a great deal of their time trying to create order out of chaos,
and the rest of their time inventing new ways to create more chaos.
Object-oriented programming serves both needs well:
it allows good software designers to create marvels,
and less conscientious or less experienced ones to manufacture horrors.

R has not one, not two, but at least three different frameworks for object-oriented programming.
By far the most widely used is [S3](#S3)
(because it was first introduced with Version 3 of S,
the language from which R is derived).
Unlike the approaches used in Python and similarly pedestrian languages,
S3 does not require users to define classes.
Instead,
they add [attributes](glossary.html#attribute) to data,
then write specialized versions of [generic functions](glossary.html#generic-function)
to process data identified by those attributes.
Since attributes can be used in other ways as well,
we will start by exploring them.

### What are attributes?

Let's begin by creating a matrix containing the first few hundreds:

```{r create-hundreds}
values <- 100 * 1:9 # creates c(100, 200, ..., 900)
m <- matrix(values, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
m
```

Behind the scenes,
R continues to store our nine values as a vector.
However,
it adds an attribute called `class` to the vector to identify it as a matrix:

```{r class-of-matrix}
class(m)
```

and another attribute called `dim` to store its dimensions as a 2-element vector:

```{r dim-of-matrix}
dim(m)
```

An object's attributes are simply a set of name-value pairs.
We can find out what attributes are present using `attributes` and show or set individual attributes using `attr`:

```{r look-at-attributes}
attr(m, "prospects") <- "dismal"
attributes(m)
```

What are the type and attributes of a tibble?

```{r attributes-of-tibble}
t <- tribble(
  ~a, ~b,
  1, 2,
  3, 4)
typeof(t)
attributes(t)
```

This tells us that a tibble is stored as a list (the first line of output),
and that it has an attribute called `names` that stores the names of its columns,
another called `row.names` that stores the names of its rows (a feature we should ignore),
and three classes.
These classes tell R what functions to search for when we are (for example)
asking for the length of a tibble (which is the number of rows it contains):

```{r length-of-tibble}
length(t)
```

### How are classes represented?

To show how classes and generic functions work together,
let's customize the way that 2D coordinates are converted to strings.
First,
we create two coordinate vectors:

```{r create-coordinates}
first <- c(0.5, 0.7)
class(first) <- "two_d"
print(first)
second <- c(1.3, 3.1)
class(second) <- "two_d"
print(second)
```

Separately, we define the behavior of `toString` for such objects:

```{r tostring-twod}
toString.two_d <- function(obj){
  paste0("<", obj[1], ", ", obj[2], ">")
}
toString(first)
toString(second)
```

S3's protocol is simple:
given a function F and an object of class C,
S3 looks for a function named F.C.
If it doesn't find one,
it looks at the object's next class (assuming it has more than one);
once its user-assigned classes are exhausted,
it uses whatever function the system has defined for its base type (in this case, character vector).
We can trace this process by importing the sloop package and calling `s3_dispatch`:

```{r s3-dispatch}
library(sloop)
s3_dispatch(toString(first))
```

Compare this with calling `toString` on a plain old character vector:

```{r s3-dispatch-tostring}
s3_dispatch(toString(c(7.1, 7.2)))
```

The specialized functions associated with a generic function like `toString` are called [methods](glossary.html#method).
Unlike languages that require methods to be defined all together as part of a class,
S3 allows us to add methods when and as we see fit.
But that doesn't mean we should:
minds confined to three dimensions of space and one of time are simply not capable of comprehending
complex class hierarchies.
Instead,
we should always write three functions that work together for a class like `two_d`:

- A [constructor](glossary.html#constructor) called `new_two_d`
  that creates objects of our class.
- An optional [validator](glossary.html#validator) called `validate_two_d`
  that checks the consistency and correctness of an object's values.
- An optional [helper](glossary.html#helper), simply called `two_d`,
  that most users will call to create and validate objects.

The constructor's first argument should always be the base object (in our case, the two-element vector).
It should also have one argument for each attribute the object is to have, if any.
Unlike matrices, our 2D points don't have any extra arguments, so our constructor needs no extra arguments.
Crucially,
the constructor checks the type of its arguments to ensure that the object has at least some chance of being valid.

```{r new-two-d}
new_two_d <- function(coordinates){
  stopifnot(is.numeric(coordinates))
  class(coordinates) <- "two_d"
  coordinates
}

example <- new_two_d(c(4.4, -2.2))
toString(example)
```

Validators are only needed when checks on data correctness and consistency are expensive.
For example,
if we were to define a class to represent sorted vectors,
checking that each element is no less than its predecessor could take a long time for very long vectors.
To illustrate this,
we will check that we have exactly two coordinates;
in real code,
we would probably include this (inexpensive) check in the constructor.

```{r validate-two-d, error=TRUE}
validate_two_d <- function(coordinates) {
  stopifnot(length(coordinates) == 2)
  stopifnot(class(coordinates) == "two_d")
}

validate_two_d(example)    # should succeed silently
validate_two_d(c(1, 3))    # should fail
validate_two_d(c(2, 2, 2)) # should also fail
```

The third and final function in our trio provides a user-friendly way to construct objects of our new class.
It should call the constructor and the validator (if one exists),
but should also provide a richer set of defaults,
better error messages,
and so on.
To illustrate this,
we shall allow the user to provide either one argument (which must be a two-element vector)
or two (which must each be numeric):

```{r two-d-with-defaults}
two_d <- function(...){
  args <- list(...)
  if (length(args) == 1) {
    args <- args[[1]]    # extract original value
  }
  else if (length(args) == 2) {
    args <- unlist(args) # convert list to vector
  }
  result <- new_two_d(args)
  validate_two_d(result)
  result
}

here <- two_d(10.1, 11.2)
toString(here)
there <- two_d(c(15.6, 16.7))
toString(there)
```

### How does inheritance work?

We said above that an object can have more than one class,
and that S3 searches the classes in order when it wants to find a method to call.
Methods can also trigger invocation of other methods explicitly in order to supplement,
rather than replace,
the behavior of other classes.
To show how this works,
we shall look at that classic of object-oriented design: shapes.
(The safe kind,
of course,
not those whose non-Euclidean angles have placed such intolerable stress on the minds of so many of our colleagues over the years.)
We start by defining a `polygon` class:

```{r polygon-class}
new_polygon <- function(coords, name) {
  points <- map(coords, two_d)
  class(points) <- "polygon"
  attr(points, "name") <- name
  points
}

toString.polygon <- function(poly) {
  paste0(attr(poly, "name"), ": ", paste0(map(poly, toString), collapse = ", "))
}

right <- new_polygon(list(c(0, 0), c(1, 0), c(0, 1)), "triangle")
toString(right)
```

Now we will add colored shapes:

```{r colored-polygon}
new_colored_polygon <- function(coords, name, color) {
  object <- new_polygon(coords, name)
  attr(object, "color") <- color
  class(object) <- c("colored_polygon", class(object))
  object
}

pinkish <- new_colored_polygon(list(c(0, 0), c(1, 0), c(1, 1)), "triangle", "roseate")
class(pinkish)
toString(pinkish)
```

So far so good:
since we have not defined a method to handle colored polygons specifically,
we get the behavior for a regular polygon.
Let's add another method that supplements the behavior of the existing method:

```{r colored-polygon-tostring}
toString.colored_polygon <- function(poly) {
  paste0(toString.polygon(poly), "+ color = ", attr(poly, "color"))
}

toString(pinkish)
```

In practice,
we will almost always place all of the methods associated with a class in the same file as its constructor, validator, and helper.
The time has finally come for us to explore projects and packages.

## How can we write web applications in R?

R has this awesome gnarly web programming framework called Shiny.
It uses ~~sympathetic magic~~ ~~quantum entanglement~~ reactive variables
to update the application's interface when data changes.
You should, like, totally check it out.

## How can we work with relational databases in R?

Data frames and database tables go together as naturally as chocolate and the tears of our fallen foes.
As in Python and other languages,
there is a standard interface for connecting to and querying relational databases;
each database is then supported by a package that implements that interface.
This doesn't completely hide the differences between databases—we must still worry about
the quirks of various SQL dialects—but it does keep the R side of things simple.

This tutorial uses the SQLite database and the RSQLite interface package.
The former is included with the latter,
so `install.packages("RSQLite")` will give you everything you need.
We assume that you already speak enough SQL to get yourself into trouble;
if you do not, [this tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/) is a good place to start.

### How can we get data from a database?

Suppose we have a small database in `data/example.db`
containing survey data salvaged from a series of doomed expeditions to the Antarctic in the 1920s and 1930s.
The database contains four tables:

**Person**: people who took readings.

|person_id |personal |family    |
|----------|---------|----------|
|dyer      |William  |Dyer      |
|pb        |Frank    |Pabodie   |
|lake      |Anderson |Lake      |
|roe       |Valentina|Roerich   |
|danforth  |Frank    |Danforth  |

**Site**: locations where readings were taken.

|site_id |lat    |long    |
|--------|-------|--------|
|DR-1    |-49.85 |-128.57 |
|DR-3    |-47.15 |-126.72 |
|MSK-4   |-48.87 |-123.4  |

**Visited**: when readings were taken at specific sites.

|visit_id |site_id |dated      |
|---------|--------|-----------|
|619      |DR-1    |1927-02-08 |
|622      |DR-1    |1927-02-10 |
|734      |DR-3    |1930-01-07 |
|735      |DR-3    |1930-01-12 |
|751      |DR-3    |1930-02-26 |
|752      |DR-3    |-null-     |
|837      |MSK-4   |1932-01-14 |
|844      |DR-1    |1932-03-22 |

**Measurements**: the actual readings.

|visit_id |visitor |quantity |reading |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
|619      |dyer    |rad      |9.82    |
|619      |dyer    |sal      |0.13    |
|622      |dyer    |rad      |7.8     |
|622      |dyer    |sal      |0.09    |
|734      |pb      |rad      |8.41    |
|734      |lake    |sal      |0.05    |
|734      |pb      |temp     |-21.5   |
|735      |pb      |rad      |7.22    |
|735      |-null-  |sal      |0.06    |
|735      |-null-  |temp     |-26.0   |
|751      |pb      |rad      |4.35    |
|751      |pb      |temp     |-18.5   |
|751      |lake    |sal      |0.1     |
|752      |lake    |rad      |2.19    |
|752      |lake    |sal      |0.09    |
|752      |lake    |temp     |-16.0   |
|752      |roe     |sal      |41.6    |
|837      |lake    |rad      |1.46    |
|837      |lake    |sal      |0.21    |
|837      |roe     |sal      |22.5    |
|844      |roe     |rad      |11.25   |

Let's get the data about the people into a data frame:

```{r first-simple-query}
library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), here::here("data", "example.db"))
dbGetQuery(db, "select * from Person;")
```

That seems simple enough:
the database connection is the first argument to `dbGetQuery`,
the query itself is the second,
and the result is a tibble whose column names correspond to the names of the fields in the database table.
What if we want to parameterize our query?
Inside the text of the query,
we use `:name` as a placeholder for a query parameter,
then pass a list of name-value pairs to specify what we actually want:

```{r parameterized-query}
dbGetQuery(db,
           "select * from Measurements where quantity = :desired",
           params = list(desired = "rad"))
```

Do *not* use `glue` or some other kind of string interpolation to construct database queries,
as this can leave you open to [SQL injection attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)
and other forms of digital damnation.

If you expect a large set of results,
it's best to page through them:

```{r paged-query}
results <- dbSendQuery(db, "select * from Measurements limit 15;")
while (!dbHasCompleted(results)) {
  chunk <- dbFetch(results, n = 3) # artificially low for tutorial purposes
  print(chunk)
}
dbClearResult(results)
```

### How can we populate databases with R?

Data scientists spend most of their time reading data, but someone has to create it.
RSQLite makes it easy to map a data frame directly to a database table;
to show how it works,
we will create an in-memory database:

```{r in-memory-create}
colors <- tribble(
  ~name, ~red, ~green, ~blue,
  'black', 0, 0, 0,
  'yellow', 255, 255, 0,
  'aqua', 0, 255, 255,
  'fuchsia', 255, 0, 0
)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ':memory:')
dbWriteTable(db, "colors", colors)
```

Let's see what the combination of R and SQLite has done with our data and the types thereof:

```{r in-memory-fetch}
dbGetQuery(db, "select * from colors;")
```

Good: the types have been guessed correctly.

But what about dates?

```{r test-with-dates}
appointments <- tribble(
  ~who, ~when,
  'Dyer', '1927-03-01',
  'Peabody', '1927-05-05'
) %>% mutate(when = lubridate::as_date(when))
dbWriteTable(db, "appointments", appointments)
dbGetQuery(db, "select * from appointments;")
```

What fresh hell is this?
After considerable trial and error,
we discover that our dates have been returned to us as
the number of days since January 1, 1970:

```{r proof-of-madness}
dbExecute(db,
           "insert into appointments values('Testing', :the_date);",
           params = list(the_date = lubridate::as_date('1971-01-01')))
dbGetQuery(db, "select * from appointments where who = 'Testing';")
```

There is no point screaming:
those who might pity you cannot hear,
and those who can hear will definitely not pity you.
